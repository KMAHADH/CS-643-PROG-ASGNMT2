## Overview
 To build a  "Wine Quality prediction Machine Learning model in Spark over AWS which must be trained in parallel using 4 EC2 instances.

## Project end results:
This project focuses on developing parallel machine learning (ML) applications in Amazon
AWS cloud platform.
The requirements are: 

(a) Use of Apache Spark to train an ML model in parallel on multiple EC2 instances; 
(b) Using Sparkâ€™s MLlib to develop and use an ML model in the cloud; 
(c) Using Docker to create a container.

## Project specifics:

(1) Input for model training: 
    (a) TrainingDataset.csv (for model training.)  
    (b) ValidationDataset.csv (for model validation.)

(2) Input for prediction testing: 
    (a) TestDataset.csv (the actual dataset)

(3) Output: 
    (a) The measure of the prediction performance is the F1 score that's generated. 

(4) Model Implementation: 
To develop a Spark application that uses MLlib to train for wine quality prediction using the Sampldatasets for training.
